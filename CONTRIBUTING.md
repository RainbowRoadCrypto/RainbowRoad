## About RainbowRoad

RainbowRoad is a fully open-source project and is not backed by any investors or businesses. It is developed and maintained by a community of volunteers who are passionate about advancing cross-chain communication and blockchain interoperability. We believe in the power of open collaboration and transparency to create robust and innovative solutions.
